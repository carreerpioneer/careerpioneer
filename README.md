# Career Pioneer
Career Pioneer is a job tracking application for anyone wanting assistance with their job search. Users are able to sign up and start creating jobs that they have applied for or want a saved record to go back to later. Users can create many platforms that they search for jobs on, application statuses, and more advanced job details. All of these fields will be applied to each job you track so you never have to question where you are in the job application process.
